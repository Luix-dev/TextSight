## TextSight
TextSight is an Obsidian plugin that leverages OpenAI's advanced language models to analyze your notes and uncover connections based on topics, keywords, and named entities. It utilizes Dexie.js as a wrapper for IndexedDB, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval within the plugin. TextSight helps you visualize these connections in a 3D environment, providing a holistic view of your research or notes. This tool is designed to assist you in discovering hidden insights, navigating through your ideas, and gaining a deeper understanding of your data.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a developer, designer, or tester, there's a place for you in the TextSight project. Check out our GitHub Issues for tasks that need attention.

If you'd like to write some code but don't know where to start, we've written some ToDos.

## Feedback and Testing

Testers are always welcome. Give TextSight a try, analyze a few documents, and provide feedback (preferably on Discord). Your insights are invaluable in making TextSight better.

TextSight currently uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model, so you need an API key. If you cannot get one, we have a few keys with a $5 budget each for you. With $5 you'll be able to analyze a significant number of documents.
